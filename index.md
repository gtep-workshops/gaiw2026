## Thanks for a Great Workshop!
We had a great workshop this year – you can watch the full video on YouTube [Here](YouTube Link).

The full program and all papers will remain available on the [Program](https://preflib.github.io/gaiw2025/program/) page.

Look forward to seeing you all next time!

## About the Games, Agents, and Incentives Workshop

We invite submissions to the 8th iteration of the Games, Agents and Incentives Workshop, co-located with AAMAS 2026 in Paphos, Cyprus.

Games, Agents and Incentives is a confederated workshop which focuses (obviously…) on agents and incentives in AI. In particular on game theory (cooperative and non-cooperative), social choice, and agent-mediated e-commerce aspects of AI systems. The confederated workshop merges multiple workshops that have been associated with AAMAS in the past, which considered different aspects of the general interplay between AI and economics:
* CoopMAS: Cooperative Games in Multi-agent Systems
* AMEC:  Agent-Mediated Electronic Commerce
* EXPLORE: Exploring Beyond the Worst Case in Computational Social Choice

Over the past two decades, the focus of agent incentives in centralised and decentralised AI systems has increased dramatically. These issues come up when designing preference aggregation mechanisms and markets; computing equilibria and bidding strategies; facilitating cooperation among agents; and fairly dividing resources.

## Important Dates
* Submission Deadline: ~~February 4, 2026~~ **Extended to Feb. 11, 2026** (AoE) ([Link](https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2026/Workshop/GAIW))
* Acceptance Notification: March 20, 2026
* Camera Ready: TBD (AoE)
* AAMAS Conference: May 25 - May 29, 2026

## About GAIW

The focus on games, agents, and incentives in AI venues (including AAMAS, AAAI, & IJCAI) can be judged from the significant proportion of technical program sessions which deal with “economic paradigms”; “mathematical social sciences”; “auctions and markets”; “non-cooperative games”; “cooperative games”; “social choice”. One goal of the workshop is to provide a forum to present the latest research, including research that can benefit from further discussion and feedback. The workshop’s goal is to bring together researchers in the fields related to algorithmic mechanism design, computational social choice, and fair division while providing a platform for cross-fertilization of ideas between junior and senior researchers in these fields. 

The workshop fits the type of research valued by the AI and agents communities. In the last 30 years, 9 of the 22 winners of the IJCAI Computer and Thought Award worked on topics in the intersection of AI and economics/agents: specifically, Sarit Kraus (1995), Nicholas Jennings (1999), Tuomas Sandholm (2003), Peter Stone (2007), Carlos Guestrin (2009), Vincent Conitzer (2011), Ariel Procaccia (2015), and Piotr Skowron (2020), Nisarg Shah (2024). Similarly, 12 of the 18 awardees of the Victor Lesser IFAAMAS Distinguished Dissertation Award work on topics in this strategic intersection: Vincent Conitzer (2006), Radu Jurca (2007), Ariel Procaccia (2008), Andrew Gilpin (2009), Bo An (2010), Manish Jain (2013), Yair Zick (2014), Nisarg Shah (2016), and Dominik Peters (2020) (we note that Dr. Haifeng Xu was a runner-up for the award in 2019), Noam Brown (2020), Bryan Wilder (2021), and Niclas Boehmer (2023).
